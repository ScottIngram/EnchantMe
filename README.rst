Enchant Me (WoW addon)
######################

This small addon will notify you of missing enchantments and gems on your equipped items.

The following indicators can appear on equipped items:

- ``E`` - missing enchant
- ``G`` - missing gem
- ``S`` - missing socket

This also works when inspecting other players.

Note: Only the current expansion is supported. The check is disabled on low level characters.
