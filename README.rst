Enchant Me (WoW addon)
######################

This small addon will notify you of missing enchantments and gems on your equipped items.

The following indicators can appear on equipped items:

- ``E`` - missing enchant
- ``G`` - missing gem
- ``S`` - missing socket (Dragonflight necklaces can have up to 3)

This also works when inspecting other players.

Note: Only Dragonflight content is supported. The check is disabled on characters below level 60.
